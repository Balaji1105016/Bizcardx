# Bizcardx

1. Installing the required packages: We will need to install Python, Streamlit,
                       easyOCR, and a database management system like SQLite or MySQL.
                    2. Designing the user interface: We are creating a simple and intuitive user interface using
                       Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business
                       card image and extracting its information. We are using widgets like file
                       uploader, buttons, and text boxes to make the interface more interactive.
                    3. Implementing the image processing and OCR: Using easyOCR to extract the
                       relevant information from the uploaded business card image. We are using
                       image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and thresholding to
                       enhance the image quality before passing it to the OCR engine.
                    4. Displaying the extracted information: Once the information has been extracted,We are
                       displaying it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI. We are using
                       widgets like tables, text boxes, and labels to present the information.
                    5. Implementing database integration: Using a database management system like
                       SQLite or MySQL we are storing the extracted information along with the uploaded
                       business card image. We are using SQL queries to create tables, insert data,
                       and retrieve data from the database, Update the data and allowing the users to
                       delete the data through the streamlit UI.
                    6. Testing the application: Testing the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as
                       expected. We are running the application on our local machine by running the
                       command streamlit run Bizcard.py in the terminal, where Bizcard.py is the name of
                       our Streamlit application file.
                    7. Improving the application: Continuously improving the application by adding new
                       features, optimizing the code, and fixing bugs.
